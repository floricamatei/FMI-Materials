            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>Jotun is one of those indie games that you tend to ignore at first since very few people actually talked about it, but once you finally play it you are instantly drawn in by the beauty that this game truly is. It’s been lying around in my library for at least five months, and after playing it I was shocked that I hadn't touched it earlier. I was hesitant thinking all it had to offer was a couple of really hard bosses, but oh my god, I couldn't have been more wrong... It was one of the best indie I have ever played! The envoirment, the bosses and the animations are wonderful. You have a little move set and some abilities but the game design matches perfectly with them! The OST during the last phase of the final boss? Just incredible. I really had my doubts about the graphics since the hand drawn yet minimalistic boss designs looked like a child drew them, but I was wrong again. The art works really well once you see it in motion and they really did an incredible job with the animations overall. The background is very clean but more detailed, and works nicely together nicely with the "amateurish" drawings of objects, bosses and enemies. Once you feel the music, sounds and animations in action, you’ll realize the devs knew what they were doing, it just works! So, don’t let the minimalistic graphics fool you, this is an excellent game for those who enjoy good boss fights and challenging gameplay. While the game is only about four to six hours long, the boss rush mode will keep you occupied for even longer. Fans of norse mythology will also find great value in this game as it’s world filled with legends and mythological beings.</p>
