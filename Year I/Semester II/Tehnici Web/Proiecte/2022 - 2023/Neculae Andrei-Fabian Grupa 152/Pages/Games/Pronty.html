            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>Pronty is an under the sonar underwater masterpiece. The care for details in Pronty is lovely. You have a dark story masked under a cute artstyle with friendly funny characters. The game is simply mesmerizing and has a great hook. The graphics are stunning, with good use of colors and animation. The art-style is distinct and easily identifiable with creative enemy design. The adventure sense is amazing. The world of Pronty is also quite realized, featuring a future where itâ€™s an apocalyptic future scenario but it plays out under the ocean. It has cute characters and good variety of mobs and bosses. I was drawn into the story, the characters, the art and the combat loop. It was a constant surprise at every corner. The boss fights are some of the best I've ever played, and the eye candy is phenomenal. It is a treat at every step. Game definitely isn't on the easy side, the difficulty feels just right, challenging without feeling tedious and even with an easy mode. I truly think it is a video game masterpiece. I take saying that VERY seriously. I loved every second I spent inside Pronty and I can say without a doubt that he game is absolutely obsessed with making sure it looks and feels good. And they did a great job making this video game.</p>
