            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>The year is 1274. Samurai warriors are the legendary defenders of Japan - until the fearsome Mongol Empire invades the island of Tsushima, wreaking havoc and conquering the local population. As one of the last surviving samurai, you rise from the ashes to fight back. But, honorable tactics won't lead you to victory. You must move beyond your samurai traditions to forge a new way of fighting - the way of the Ghost - as you wage an unconventional war for the freedom of Japan.</p>

            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>Ghost of Tsushima is a fictional tale told with fictional characters, but it's based on the very real invasion of Japan by the Mongol Empire in 1274 that began on the Island of Tsushima. You take control of Jin Sakai, capably acted by The Man in the High Castle's Daisuke Tsuji, who starts off as a samurai before a disastrous battle against the invaders quickly teaches him that perhaps the honorable but restrictive ways of the samurai code might not be enough to deal with this new and existential threat.Ghost of Tsushima revolves around this inner conflict as Jin's formative teachings push up against his need to save his homeland at any cost, and though it takes a little while to really get going, it's a compelling struggle. The little touches go a long way toward combat's exquisite feel, in addition to bringing a bit of visual spectacle. The best part, though, is that there's no traditional level-based stat progression. When you get stronger in Ghost of Tsushima, it's not because invisible numbers went up and now you deal more damage and take less when you're hit; it's because your techniques got better and now you have new, better ways of dealing with tougher enemies. It's so incredibly satisfying. When you level up you might spend a point to unlock the ability to block a previously unblockable attack from spear-wielding enemies, or you could choose the ability to block arrows so you can better deal with situations where you're surrounded by archers. It's fantastic because it means that you'll never run into an area in Ghost of Tsushima where, all of the sudden, you're getting one-hit killed by archers who you'd previously brushed off, or having to spend a week chopping away at the sword equivalent of a bullet sponge just because they're arbitrarily several levels higher than you. Crucially, this removes the problem of being forced to grind sidequests in order to reach a certain level minimum in order to progress in the story, which is something that certain other games are notorious for.</p>
