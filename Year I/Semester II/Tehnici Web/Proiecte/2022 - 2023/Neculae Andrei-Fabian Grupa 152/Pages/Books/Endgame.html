            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>Twelve thousand years ago, they came. They descended from the sky amid smoke and fire, and created humanity and gave us rules to live by. They needed gold and they built our earliest civilizations to mine it for them. When they had what they needed, they left. But before they left, they told us someday they would come back, and when they did, a game would be played. A game that would determine our future. This is Endgame.</p>

            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>This book is interesting from the beginning. I have read some reviews of this book where a lot of people complain that the book's writing style is so basic that there is no point in reading the book, as well as the fact that this is another book trying to rip off The Hunger Games. I can't agree with this; there were many elements which were widely different. I love this book because I genuinely believe the style of writing and the plot work. The writing style is simple. I'll admit that it is quite clearly not the most complex piece of writing that I have read as a whole, but I don't think that is what gives this book its appealing quality. I believe that the writing style almost complements the style of the story. The plot in itself follows a group of twelve completely different teenagers in a battle of logic and stealth across the world in order for them to save themselves and their bloodline. The writing style is interesting as it doesn't just follow one of the twelve, but all of them. This is an interesting choice as as a reader we are unsure of who to root for and who to hate; the un-traditional, simple writing style aids this choice as it leaves the decision completely up to you. By using simplistic writing, the author shows no bias towards any of the characters, the only exception being that Jago, Sarah, Chiyoko, Baitsakhan, and Maccabee have more sections than the other players. This is why I think the writing works; the impersonal, straight-forward description makes the book seem almost like sports coverage on the TV, complementing Endgame's ruthless and fast-paced nature. Overall, I really enjoyed this book. I loved how you could hate someone at one moment, and then the next love them, as the decision was left completely up to you. It felt like throughout you were playing a game of trust with the characters, as just as you decide that you are rooting for them, they do something completely unexpected and terrifying and you're back to square one again.</p>
