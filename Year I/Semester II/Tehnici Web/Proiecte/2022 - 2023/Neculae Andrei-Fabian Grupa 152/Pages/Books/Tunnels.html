            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>14-year-old Will Burrows has little in common with his strange, dysfunctional family. In fact, the only bond he shares with his eccentric father is a passion for archaeological excavation. So when his dad mysteriously vanishes, Will is compelled to dig up the truth behind his disappearance. He unearths the unbelievable: a subterranean society that time forgot. "The Colony" has existed unchanged for a century, but it's no benign time capsule of a bygone era. Because the Colony is ruled by a merciless overclass, the Styx. Will must free his father - is he also about to ignite a revolution?</p>

            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>Tunnels is an adventure book set in present day London that follows the exploits of Will Burrows, fourteen years old and just as obsessed with digging as his museum curator father. The first chapter of the book finds us already underground with Will and Mr. Burrows and their amazing discovery of a disused rail station. Not content with these exciting ventures with his father, Will begins his own secret digs, unaware that his father has done exactly the same thing. It is only when Will's father suddenly disappears that Will unearths his father's hidden tunnel that leads to a whole new world and so begins the adventure of a lifetime to find his dad. Will is similarly focused only on his hobby and his friendship with Chester, another loner he meets at school. The story of a boy finding a whole new world right under our feet is a fantastic and exciting subject. There are a few neat twists in the plot and the detail given of the underground is wonderful, from the eerily replicated streets and houses to the adapted and rather strange diet that Will and Chester find themselves having to survive on.</p>
