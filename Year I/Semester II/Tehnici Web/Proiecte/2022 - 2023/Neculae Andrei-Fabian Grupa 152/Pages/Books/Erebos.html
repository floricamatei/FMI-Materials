            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>When 16-year-old Nick receives a package containing the mysterious computer game Erebos, he wonders if it will explain the behavior of his classmates, who have been secretive lately. Players of the game must obey strict rules: always play alone, never talk about the game, and never tell anyone your nickname. Curious, Nick joins the game and quickly becomes addicted. But Erebos knows a lot about the players and begins to manipulate their lives. When it sends Nick on a deadly assignment, he refuses and is banished from the game. Now unable to play, Nick turns to a friend for help in finding out who controls the game. The two set off on a dangerous mission in which the border between reality and the virtual world begins to blur. This utterly convincing and suspenseful thriller originated in Germany, where it has become a runaway bestseller.</p>

            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>First of all, I pretty much ate this book up. The writing is so compelling and especially fitting to the storyline, since I basically was addicted to reading it. It's not an llogical storyline, there is some explanation to everything and that's why I loved it even more. For me, there have been two parts in this book: one part playing in real life, where Nick had to communicate with classmates, parents, friends or had to fulfill quests, no matter how weird and dangerous it seems. The other part of the story happened in-game. Nick wasn't Nick anymore but his alter ego Sarius, who had to fulfill quests in the medieval setting. He felt stronger there, the world of Erebos has become Nick's better life. In his real life he only was thinking about Erebos anymore. He truly became addicting until a wake up call rang and ripped him out of the game. When there has been a dangerous situation, my heart started beating because damn, the writing. You can feel with him and that's such a nice thing about the book, because you really get into it and be connected with the story.You could only hope he would choose for the better because you kind of became to know Nick and you knew he was good at heart. Oh this book with it's good characters, because there have been some of Nick's friends who you could only love. The genre could be a young adult – fantasy – thriller mix, because all of these elements are included, merging into each other. The book is set in London, but you wouldn't notice much for it in general. It could have played at any other school for example. Okay, wrongly written: you will know that is it set in London, but if I tell you why then the story is spoiled. That said, you need to explore Erebos on your own to see what I mean with all my gibberish “Oh I love it so much!” talk. Close to the Erebos players telling other non players to go and play Erebos to see what they are loving so much about this book.</p>
