            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>Since the death of his parents, Shinpei Ajiro had lived with the Kofune family and their two daughters - Mio and Ushio. Although he then left his home island to continue his education in Tokyo, Shinpei returns after Ushio tragically drowns during the attempted rescue of a little girl. During the funeral, his best friend informs him about bruises found around Ushio's neck, casting doubt over the cause of her death. Suspecting a murder has taken place, Shinpei reevaluates recent events, but strange incidents only continue to transpire. Disappearing people and other unexplainable occurrences lead Mio to recall an old folktale referring to entities called "Shadows," which may not be entirely fantasy. Supposedly, an encounter with one's Shadow foretells the person's impending demise. Facing the dark side of Hitogashima Island, Shinpei stands against his grim fate to fulfill Ushio's final will - to protect Mio.</p>

            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>Summertime Render is a time travel story. As many other time travel stories do, it capitalizes heavily on the idea of cognizant recurrence and the horror related to it. As far as time travel stories go, I think Summertime Render is very strong and easily one of the most ambitious anime that I have ever seen. It's difficult to assess the quality of plots in anime that have to do with time travel due to their inherent scientific (and often purely logical) faults with random semantic details, which may or may not even be worth docking credit off the whole. It's often the case that some paradox or convenience that comes to light instantly demerits everything that the anime in question may stand for altogether. I hate to think that such "problems" actually have a bearing on the entirety of any work. My implication isn't that Summertime Render is riddled by these, but rather that whatever slight inconsistencies there are, they're quite overshadowed by the sheer amount of complexity and logic that is put into the larger picture. Though I will admit that it wasn't without its faults, I found myself thoroughly engrossed in and constantly impressed by the twists and turns that the narrative takes. I'm a sucker for time travel done right, and I can't say this is anything but that. Whether it be the century-spanning history, the deep lore and enigma underlying the entire island, or the confusing-but-logical-when-you-really-think-about-it plot contrivances at play, I never ceased to revel in the pursuit of a happy ending presented in this show. Summertime Render's audiovisual quality is excellent on the whole. For a show with a manga that I'd never heard of before I actually watched it on a whim, I was thoroughly impressed by how high the production quality was. Of course, it goes without saying that the OST was magnificent. Overall, Summertime Render has revitalized my passion for stories with historical lore that underlies the truth. Through solid time traveling mechanics and fleshed out plot semantics, it was able to pull me in weekly, rendering me speechless by the end of the episodes towards the second half. I'm very sure that I'll come back to watch this show at some point in the future just for the thrills and will likely have an even better time with it than the first time, equipped with the power of retrospect</p>
