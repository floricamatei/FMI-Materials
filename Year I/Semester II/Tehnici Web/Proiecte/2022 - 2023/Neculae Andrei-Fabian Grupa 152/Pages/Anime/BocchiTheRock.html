            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>Yearning to make friends and perform live with a band, lonely and socially anxious Hitori "Bocchi" Gotou devotes her time to playing the guitar. On a fateful day, Bocchi meets the outgoing drummer Nijika Ijichi, who invites her to join Kessoku Band when their guitarist, Ikuyo Kita, flees before their first show. Soon after, Bocchi meets her final bandmateâ€”the cool bassist Ryou Yamada. Although their first performance together is subpar, the girls feel empowered by their shared love for music, and they are soon rejoined by Kita. Finding happiness in performing, Bocchi and her bandmates put their hearts into improving as musicians while making the most of their fleeting high school days.</p>

            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p>The main character, Hitori Gotou (nicknamed Bocchi, as in "alone") is set up as a character to relate to. Her struggles with school and social ineptitude are things that a lot of past and present students can relate to. Her mannerisms and her personality really drive this series, which makes her very likeable. It's not like her supporting cast aren't well rounded as well, all three of her bandmates all have their quirks and interests that make them stand out and add much needed diversity. The art style is more unique than what you'd think at first. It has a mix between actual realistic depictions and absolute absurdity, making the whole anime have a quirk to it that I find really appealing. Mixing that with each of the characters really creates a funny disposition. For real, this show is hilarious. In regards to the realistic depictions (basing this off of my own musical knowledge), the instrument playing is spot on. Actual attention to detail is put into the presentation, which adds nicely to the experience. Music focused anime must have a good soundtrack, and Bocchi does not let up at all. The songs created for the band are all really good. There's not much to say in the way of this since it's up to personal preference, but it is all well produced and is actually released under the in-universe name (Kessoku, or "ziptie" in Japanese). The performances in the anime that the band does perform are expertly crafted in terms of animation and music, which makes them a treat to listen too. Overall the anime is a great entry on its own. It's funny, it's entertaining and it's relatable. It touches on subjects that I myself struggle with, which really makes it that much better. Through these liaisons and the show's great content, I find myself earning for more. For a simple 4-koma manga adaptation, this anime surprised me and many others who didn't even know of its existence. I am very excited for the future of this project. Bocchi The Rock! is everything I hope to see in an anime adaptation. Faithful coherence to the source material and yet daring and passionate enough to elevate this source material beyond the rigid 4-Koma pages. </p>
